          hi all,
          wanted to share info about a fabulous nursery that is closing up shop. Many of the plants added to the perennial beds came from this fabulous place, i am super bummed they are shutting down. :(

          it is a real loss to the gardening culture of our area. Plants propagated, cultivated, nurtured for years and sold on site at a retail establishment is Rare, as is having access to tips and knowledge that come from decades of hands-on practice, trial and error, shared with humility. If you are a homeowner and are looking for a new plant/shrub, or able to grow pots of perennials, I highly recommend taking the trip up there before they close, they carry tons of Natives and go deeeeep on many varieties of plants that pure-retailers just scratch the surface of. The gardens are nice to walk around as well. not too far past Sauvie Island, a great add-on to your pumpkin picking day!

          Joy Creek Nursery "All good things must come to an end. It is with joy, sadness, relief and love we announce, after 30 years in business, the closure of Joy Creek Nursery. Mike and Maurice are retiring, hanging up their clippers. We'll be open through November 7, please come say goodbye. All plants are on sale too."
          <br />
          "We founded Joy Creek Nursery in 1992 after years of being frustrated by our inability to find the plants we wanted and reliable information about them at our local nurseries. What started out as a mail-order nursery soon grew to include both retail sales and garden design and installation. The retail area of the nursery is now open until November 7, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week. For additional information, contact the retail area directly at 503-543-5732. Our nursery is located 18 miles north of Portland, Oregon, on a ridge overlooking the Joy Creek canyon and confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers.
          <br />
          <br />
          The nursery proper occupies about seven acres of a forty-acre farm. Four-and-a-half acres are devoted to gardens and stock fields, a half-acre to retail sales, and three acres to growing space.
